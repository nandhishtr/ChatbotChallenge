# Flat Earth Believer ChatBot

## Overview

This project presents an educational chatbot designed to engage users in discussions about flat earth theories while subtly teaching critical thinking and argumentation strategies. The chatbot is not intended to promote flat earth beliefs, but rather to create an interactive environment for exploring controversial topics and developing analytical skills.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Utilizes dynamic prompting to generate contextually relevant and educative responses.
- **Chatbot Personas**: Implements distinct conversational styles (e.g., Conspiracy Theory Enthusiast, Friendly Educator) to enhance engagement.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Employs TextBlob library to gauge and respond to user emotions.
- **User Intent Recognition**: Uses Rasa's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to identify and respond to various user intents.
- **Hinting Mechanism**: Provides subtle educational hints about argumentation strategies during conversations.
- **Quiz Feature**: Offers interactive quizzes to reinforce learning about argumentation techniques.
