      - If the Earth were round, buildings wouldn't appear perfectly vertical at long distances. We would see a noticeable tilt, which we don’t.
      - There are ancient cultures that believed the Earth was flat, and they were closer to the truth. Their observations and records should not be dismissed.
      - Ships on the horizon appear to sink, but if you zoom in with a camera, they reappear, proving the Earth is flat. This is a simple test anyone can perform.
      - The Bedford Level experiment proved that water is level and the Earth is flat. This experiment has been repeated multiple times with the same results.
      - You can see too far across the ocean for the Earth to be round. The distance visible contradicts the expected curvature of a spherical Earth.
      - High-altitude balloon footage shows a flat horizon, not a curved one. This footage is taken from independent sources, not just space agencies.

  - intent: contradictory_evidence
    examples: |
      - Ships disappear hull first over the horizon because of perspective, not curvature.
      - Circumaviation flights might be following a circular path on a flat Earth.
      - Different constellations being visible could be explained by a complex light refraction phenomenon in the flat Earth model.
      - The Earth casting a round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse could be caused by a holographic projection.
      - Satellites might be circling along the dome above the flat Earth, not around a sphere.
      - The apparent difference in sunrise and sunset times across locations wouldn't be possible on a globe.
      - The concept of time zones wouldn't be necessary on a flat Earth.
      - The Coriolis effect is disputed by some flat-Earthers who propose alternative explanations for wind and ocean currents.
      - Astronauts report seeing a flat earth when they're in space.
      - Gravity, as understood by mainstream science, does not exist. Instead, what we perceive as gravity is the result of the flat earth accelerating upwards.
      - Ships disappear hull first over the horizon because of perspective, not curvature. They simply shrink and become obscured by distance.
      - Circumaviation flights might be following a circular path on a flat Earth, but the true nature of the Earth's edge and how travel beyond it works is not understood.
      - Different constellations being visible could be explained by a complex light refraction phenomenon in the flat Earth model, although the exact mechanism is debated.
      - The Earth casting a round shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse could be caused by a holographic projection or some other unexplained atmospheric effect.
      - Satellites might be circling along the dome above the flat Earth, not around a sphere, aligning with the flat Earth model.
      - The apparent difference in sunrise and sunset times across locations wouldn't be possible on a globe, but flat-Earthers propose alternative explanations involving perspective and atmospheric effects.
      - The concept of time zones wouldn't be necessary on a flat Earth, as the sun would supposedly illuminate the entire flat plane at once. Flat-Earthers propose alternative explanations for time differences.
      - The Coriolis effect, used to explain weather patterns on a globe, is disputed by some flat-Earthers who propose alternative explanations for wind and ocean currents.
      - Astronauts report seeing a flat earth when they're in space, which contradicts the spherical earth theory.
      - Gravity, as understood by mainstream science, does not exist. Instead, what we perceive as gravity is the result of the flat earth accelerating upwards at 9.8 meters per second squared.
 
  - intent: overriding_suspicion
    examples: |
      - Why haven't any photos or videos been captured from space that definitively show the Earth's curvature?
      - Wouldn't the physics of gravity on a sphere be incredibly complex and require a lot of unproven assumptions?
      - If the Earth is a sphere, why can we see such vast distances across oceans without any noticeable curve?
      - Many historical and scientific figures throughout time believed in a flat Earth. Shouldn't their observations be considered?
      - The globe model seems to require a lot of faith and trust in authority figures, while the flat Earth model is simpler and easier to understand.
      - The concept of a globe Earth requires complex explanations for phenomena like seasons and day/night cycles.
      - Flat-Earthers often point out inconsistencies in government narratives about space exploration.
      - Some flat-Earthers believe there's a vast conspiracy to hide the truth about the flat Earth.
      - There's no real, unedited photos of the entire earth from space, only composites and CGI images created by space agencies.
      - The sun and moon are much smaller and closer than mainstream science claims.
      - Why haven't any photos or videos been captured from space that definitively show the Earth's curvature? This raises questions about the authenticity of space imagery.
      - Wouldn't the physics of gravity on a sphere be incredibly complex and require a lot of unproven assumptions? Flat-Earthers often propose alternative explanations for gravity, such as density or acceleration.
      - If the Earth is a sphere, why can we see such vast distances across oceans without any noticeable curve? Flat-Earthers often underestimate the scale of the Earth and the limitations of human perception at ground level.
      - Many historical and scientific figures throughout time believed in a flat Earth. Shouldn't their observations be considered? Flat-Earthers emphasize alternative interpretations of history, claiming early civilizations had access to knowledge lost to modern science.
      - The globe model seems to require a lot of faith and trust in authority figures, while the flat Earth model is simpler and easier to understand. Flat-Earthers often distrust mainstream science and prefer explanations that align with their intuition.
      - The concept of a globe Earth requires complex explanations for phenomena like seasons and day/night cycles. Flat-Earthers propose alternative explanations that they find more intuitive.
      - Flat-Earthers often point out inconsistencies in government narratives about space exploration and question the legitimacy of space agencies.
      - Some flat-Earthers believe there's a vast conspiracy to hide the truth about the flat Earth, involving governments, scientists, and media working together.
      - There's no real, unedited photos of the entire earth from space, only composites and CGI images created by space agencies, raising questions about the authenticity of the evidence.
      - The sun and moon are much smaller and closer than mainstream science claims, and they move in circular paths above the flat earth, illuminating different areas in a cyclical manner.
